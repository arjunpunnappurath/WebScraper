# WebScraper
Scraper to scrape the price of a commodity that you need to buy from any e-commerce site using Python


You can make the web scraper point to any commodity in any website by changing the url field in the program with the url that you have
copied from the browser of the commodity that you are tracking for price changes.

Post the update, run the script on the terminal with the standard command python <filename> and it should display
the name of the commodity and the price that it is selling currently for.
